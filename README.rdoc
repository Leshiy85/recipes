Users:

What we have already:
- User model and validations
- user table with columns username and email

Wnat we need to do:
- Add passwords to the users table so users can be authenticated and logged in
- Use email as log in credentials, since email is unique
- Ability to register new users to use the app
- Ability to display users profile
- Ability to list users using the app
- Ability for users to log in and log out of the app
- Restrict actions like create recipe, edit recipe and like feature to logged in users only
- Restricting edit of recipes by users who created the recipes
